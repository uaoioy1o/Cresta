We sincerely thank the reviewers for their thoughtful and constructive feedback. We have carefully addressed the issues identified, particularly those concerning unclear text and annotations in the figures, by revising and refining the corresponding elements. The updated figures are now included in the revised manuscript. Below, we provide a detailed explanation of the specific improvements made:

1. The term "security standards" in the phrase "that also meet security standards" refers specifically to the generation results passing the CodeQL leak check. This clarification has been integrated to ensure the statement is precise and unambiguous.  
2. In Figure 1, the font size of "RefleXGen" was indeed disproportionately large, which may have distracted from the overall visual balance of the figure. Furthermore, certain symbols such as *fb0* in Equation 4 were insufficiently explained. These issues have been resolved in the revised version, with added explanations to ensure clarity and accessibility.  
3. The three steps of our method, namely *Step 1: Initial Code Generation*, *Step 2: Knowledge-Driven Security Feedback*, and *Step 3: Defect Fixing and Knowledge Integration*, were already listed in the manuscript. However, to provide clearer and more effective feedback, we have introduced corresponding symbols in the figures to better align the visual representation with the textual descriptions. Additionally, the figures have been further improved to enhance clarity and coherence.

Regarding the feedback on the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) section, we appreciate the opportunity to elaborate on the innovative aspects of the proposed RefleXGen method. The core novelty of RefleXGen lies in its ability to enhance the quality and security of code generation without requiring retraining or significant additional computational resources. This is achieved through the use of a reflective process designed to accumulate and leverage security knowledge iteratively.  

In our approach, each iteration builds upon the results of the previous one, incorporating reflections on earlier outputs to iteratively update a dynamic knowledge base. This dynamic knowledge base evolves continuously, enabling the system to identify and address potential security vulnerabilities more effectively over time. Specifically, the system uses the original pre-trained model to introspect and evaluate the outputs for potential defects. If the generated outputs are deemed free of defects, they are directly returned. Conversely, if issues are detected, the reflective process guides defect correction while simultaneously updating the knowledge base to prevent similar issues in future iterations. This iterative feedback loop forms the foundation of our method's ability to enhance code generation security dynamically and adaptively.
